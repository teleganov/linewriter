# linewriter

[Demo Here](https://teleganov.github.io/linewriter/)

Linewriter is essentially an app for writing lyrics. I wanted to have something where I could test out
variations of a line without having to scrap old versions or cross them out.

So, in Linewriter there you have the ability to create multiple versions of each line, and pick a "favorite"
that will be rendered in the final preview of the document.

The goal was to utilize regular key navigation (as in word processing) to
make it as intuitive as possible.
